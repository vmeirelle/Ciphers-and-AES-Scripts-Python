# Cipher Implementations in Python

This is a Python code repository containing implementations of three classical ciphers: the Caesar cipher, the Hill cipher, and the Vigenere cipher.

* CESAR Cipher: The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on.

* HILL Cipher: The Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher that operates on blocks of letters. It uses matrix multiplication to encrypt and decrypt messages. The size of the matrix used determines the length of the block of letters being encrypted.

* VIGENERE Cipher: The Vigenere cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to encrypt messages. Each letter of the keyword is used to shift the corresponding letter of the plaintext by a certain amount. The keyword is repeated as many times as necessary to cover the entire length of the plaintext. This makes it more difficult to break than simple substitution ciphers like the Caesar cipher.
